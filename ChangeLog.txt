    Food usage in manual eating setting is obtained as in earlier versions: it is the difference between damage taken and

    Fixes:
    - Surge's attack speed reduction wasn't applied to the first cast
    - Surge's attack speed reduction wasn't shown in the combat stats

v1.1.1
    Changes:
    - Added runes used statistic

    Fixes:
    - The 1st hit of a multi-attack special can't kill a monster (This affects attacks/kill and most things based on that in some way)
    - Implemented game bugfixes
        - Prayer pet now only rolls when you receive prayer xp

v1.1.0:
    Updated for Melvor Idle v0.17

    - When a Soul Split curse was selected its debuff was always active
    - Curses were rolled for while still active, resetting their duration if successful
    - Unequipping items (emptying a slot) didn't update stats
    - In prayer tooltips the cost descriptions mixed up player and enemy attacks
    - Skill levels were sometimes imported incorrectly
    - Style issues

    Known issues:
    - Slayer's Crossbow should no longer activate against slayer task monsters inside dungeons.
      Because Combat Simulator simulates every monster individually and does not simulate these 14 monsters again specifically for dungeons, it cannot both apply this bonus outside of dungeons and not apply it inside of dungeons.

    - Renamed fork to Combat Simulator Reloaded
    - Bars can now be selected by clicking above them instead of only on the bars themselves, and their tooltips will also appear even when you hover above them
