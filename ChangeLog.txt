    existing save slots and exports that contain equipment data as an array will be converted to a map on import to avoid errors, but should be re-exported/re-saved after import to avoid errors in the future

        selecting a target will scroll the plotter and select the target
        can be used when both inspecting and not inspecting a target
        for cases where duplicate monsters are present, only the first is selected
        the dropdown has a max width, as some target names are quite long, this is intended
        the dropdown value is cleared when manually selecting a bar on the plotter
        selecting the none option does nothing, but serves as the empty default state, it does not clear the current selection

v3.0.31
    fixed abyssal arrows and abyssal bolts not showing

v3.0.30

        call `mod.api.mythCombatSimulator.registerNamespace` BEFORE loading any data.json or data builders
        eg. `mod.api.mythCombatSimulator?.registerNamespace('mythMusic')`

    improved tooltip close event on mobile to only close when tapping and not when scrolling

v3.0.0
    BREAKING:
        importing combat sim settings pre v3 will not import agility obstacles/pillars

    web worker has been re-written to improve ease of maintainability
    the user interface has been re-written and re-designed
        mobile users should see an improved user experience

    simulating all will no longer spam error notifications for each slayer area that cannot be accessed, instead a single generic message is now shown
    replaced spider lair and into the mist random monsters with one of each possible random monster
        this means that simulating these dungeons will not give accurate clear results, but it never did before with the random monsters either
        this allows you to simulate against all possible options that the dungeon could potentially throw at you
    added hints for into the mist, impending darkness and spider lair explaining why these dungeon results are not accurate
    fixed dungeon gp calculation being incorrect
        the source of this bug was that chests were not being opened, the gp calculation now calculates if the chests are opened and the loot sold
        this can dramatically change gp calculations for dungeons, eg. lightning region with 92 clears / h was 10m/h now correctly calculates at 200m/h selling all loot from chests
    fixed signet drop chance calculations not working for slayer tasks
    fixed pet percentage calculations not working at all
    added summoning mark percentage calculations to results
        the line item shows the percentage of seeing any mark for the selected skill
        hovering over the line item shows the percentage of seeing a specific mark for the selected skill
        no validation is performed whether a mark is unlocked or completed
    the skill dropdown now displays at all times instead of just for the pet plot type
    switching between prayer types no longer prevents the switch if all other conditions of equiping the prayer are met, it now automatically de-selects the existing prayers and switches
        ie. you have 2 normal prayers equipped, you have 2 unholy items equipped and you select an unholy prayer. the normal prayers will be unquipped and the unholy prayer is selected
        previously you would have to manually unequip the normal prayers then equip the unholy prayer

        mod data added/modified through json or the builder before the interface is ready
        mod skills 'exist' in the simulator but as dummy skills that do nothing

    PLEASE NOTE: Mod functionality will not be fully supported or be as accurate as the normal game.
    I will not endeavour to get mod data accurate, there are too many limitations in technology
    and breadth of functionality to have this work like the normal game.

    the following mod functionality is still NOT supported
        mod data added/modified after the interface has loaded
        mod patched functions

        does nothing if the target cannot be found for any reason
        automatically enables the bar if disabled
        if the current monster is the current slayer task will select the slayer tier
        if the current monster is inside a dungeon will select the dungeon
        if not slayer or dungeon selects the monster
